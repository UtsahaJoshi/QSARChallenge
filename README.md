# QSARChallenge (Predict a molecule's biological activity or toxicity)
The aim is to predict a molecule's biological activity or toxicity based on its chemical structure. A dataset of molecules together with activities is available and a machine-learning model to predict the activities of new molecules is trained.

My Best Model Result:
